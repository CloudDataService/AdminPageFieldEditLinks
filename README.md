# Page Field Edit Links for ProcessWire
Adds modal editing capability to ProcessWire's Page fields in the admin editor, allowing editors to easily view/edit the content of whichever page(s) have been selected. Edit links are updated in real time. Compatible with Select, AsmSelect, PageListSelect, PageListSelectMultiple, and PageAutoComplete inputfields.

## Instructions
After installation, you will see new options for "Enable view/edit links?" and "Enable +New links?" in the Page field configuration. These settings may be enabled/disabled on a per-field basis.

### Limitations/Issues
1. When using inputfields aside from the autocomplete, a page save or reload is currently required to view and select pages which have been added via the field.

2. View buttons are not designed to work with checkboxes or radio button inputs. 

### Wishlist
1. Auto-populate new pages into the list when they're created and automatically select them.
