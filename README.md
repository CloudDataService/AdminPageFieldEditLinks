# Page Select Edit Links for ProcessWire
Adds modal editing capability to ProcessWire's Page fields in the Admin editor, allowing editors to easily view/edit the content of whichever page(s) have been selected.

## Instructions
After installation, you will see a new "Show edit links?" option in the Page field configuration. This may be enabled/disabled on a per-field basis.

### Limitations/Issues
-When using PageListSelect, PageListSelectMultiple, and PageAutoComplete, if there is more than one page field on the edit page and at least one of them has the edit link feature enabled, all of the page fields using those inputs will show the edit links.
